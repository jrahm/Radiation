1. Intro                                                   *radiation-intro*

Radiation is a plugin for vim that does active syntax highlighting. That means that
Radiation will in the background parse the current file, looking for items to
highlight. Currently C, C++ and some JavaScript are the supported languages.

For example, if a cpp file contains:
    
    #include <cstdio>

    class MyClass {
        MyClass();

        int myfunction();
    };

    typedef int s32_t;

    typedef struct {
        int member
    } mystruct_t;


Then radiation will highlight all instances of MyClass, myfunction, s32_t, mystruct_t
and everything included from cstdio. The highlighting groups Radiation uses are

2. C++                                                      *radiation-cpp*

The C++ highlighter is automatically invoked when a C++ file is opened

Highlighting groups for C++ are as follows:

    RadiationCppTypedef            - Highlight for a typedef. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppClass              - Highlight for a C++ class. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppStruct             - Highlight for a C++ struct. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppEnum               - Highlight for a C++ enums. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppUnion              - Highlight for a C++ union. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppTemplateClass      - Highlight for a C++ class found in a template. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppTemplateTypename   - Highlight for a C++ typename found in a template. Defaultly links to Type
    RadiationCppMemberFunction     - Highlight for a C++ member function. Defaultly links to Function
    RadiationCppFunction           - Highlight for a C++ non-member function. Defaultly links to Function
